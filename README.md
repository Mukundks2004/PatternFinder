# PatternFinder
ðŸ“ˆ Give it a pattern and it will give you a polynomial

## TODO:
- Implement fraction class to get strict answers
- Have proper lagrange interpolation method to be able to take any number of f and f(x) provided same length, and produce result for any $x_n$
- update text box with styled content when finished interpolating
- do graph maybe
- fix fraction to get exact reading
- make polynomial display in nice way, without mult symbol, without ^0, without extra '+' at front, without "+-" etc.
